# Helicopter Simulation Project

## Overview

This project provides a MATLAB-based helicopter simulation environment, complete with customizable helicopter parameters, control input sliders, and real-time visualization. The simulation allows users to adjust key flight controls, including collective, cyclic pitch, cyclic roll, and tail rotor, and observe the resulting helicopter dynamics and trajectory.

## Features

- Complex helicopter dynamics modeling, including rotor aerodynamics, flapping dynamics, fuselage effects, etc.
- Real-time simulation control via graphical user interface (GUI).
- Extensive customization through various parameters, including mass properties, aerodynamic coefficients, engine characteristics, and more.
- Simulation result visualization, including trajectory plots, attitude plots, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/helicopter-simulation.git
   ```

2. Open the project in MATLAB.

3. Run the `HelicopterGUI.m` script to launch the GUI.

## Usage

1. Adjust the control input sliders for collective, cyclic pitch, cyclic roll, and tail rotor to set the desired helicopter controls.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
3. View the real-time helicopter trajectory in the plot.
4. Click the "Stop" button to end the simulation.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs` directory, including:

- `HelicopterModel.md`: Description of the helicopter dynamics model.
- `GUIUsage.md`: Guide to using the graphical user interface.
- `ParameterTuning.md`: Instructions for customizing helicopter parameters.
